I'll generate a comparison graph showing how SaiNN adaptivity differs from traditional ANN in terms of:

1. Weight Adaptability – How weights evolve dynamically in Ψ-Sai NN vs. static updates in ANN.


2. Loss Convergence – How fast Ψ-Sai NN converges compared to a traditional ANN.



Let me generate the first graph now.
